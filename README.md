- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ElodielAirea
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in Gaming. Currently in WoW and maybe in New World later.
- ğŸŒ± I've learned mostly Java, but learning Swift UI atm due to my job. (Thanks, I hate Apple <: )

So im a rookie App dev and a junior Java dev, with a bit of experience with Spring and web dev (reactjs)
