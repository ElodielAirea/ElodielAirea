- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ElodielAirea
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in Gaming. Currently in WoW and maybe in New World later.
- ðŸŒ± I've been a software dev apprentice from 2016-2019 (German term for that specialization: Fachinformatiker Fachrichtung Anwendungsentwicklung). 
      My Topics during that time were mainly "How to Google" and Java 8.
      Things I'v also came across: Spring (just a bit), Thymeleaf, HTML5, CSS3 (& SASS), ReactJS.
      Learning Swift UI atm, as they put me in an App-Dev Team. (Thanks Job, I hate Apple <: )

So im a rookie App dev and a junior Java dev, with a bit of experience with web development
